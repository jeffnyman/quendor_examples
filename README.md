# Quendor Examples

This repository is designed to provide example story files for [Quendor](https://github.com/jeffnyman/quendor). Included with this repository will be a series of data files that are decompilations of the story files.

All of the data files were created using the ztools suite. I have provided [Mac and Windows versions of these tools](https://github.com/jeffnyman/quendor_examples/tree/master/tools). Sources and the original binaries for these tools can be found in the [IFArchive ztools repository](https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/tools/ztools/).
