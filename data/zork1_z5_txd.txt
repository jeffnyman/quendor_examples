Great Underground Empire to harness the mighty Frigid River. This work was
supported by a grant of 37 million zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant
Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive structure is composed of
370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and 193 feet
wide at the top. The lake created behind the dam has a volume of 1.7 billion
cubic feet, an area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand
feet.^^The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to the
dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave drivers, 12
engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree. The work was managed
by a command team composed of 2345 bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two
of whom could type), 12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193
red tape processors, and nearly one million dead trees.^^We will now point out

west exits."

are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of
value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an open door (also

down."

ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the
prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to
the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars."
142dc: S139 "This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what
appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads
into darkness. You probably could not get back up it."
14340: S140 "This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
the dam. There are open doorways here to the north and east marked ~Private~,
and there is a path leading south over the top of the dam."
1439c: S141 "This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood
Control Dam #3. Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a group of
buttons colored blue, yellow, brown, and red. There are doorways to the west
and south."

short climb up some stairs and a narrow tunnel leading east."

ladder, leading downward. It might be safe to descend. There is also a
staircase leading upward."

wooden ladder. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room."
14608: S148 "This is a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
timbers. A wide passage comes from the east and turns at the west end of the
room into a very narrow passageway. From the west comes a strong draft."
14674: S149 "This is a small drafty room in which is the bottom of a long
shaft. To the south is a passageway and to the east a very narrow passage. In

146ec: S151 "This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal
mine. On the south wall of the chamber the letters ~Granite Wall~ are etched in

18d04: S688 "You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the Dam. The river
flows quietly here. There is a landing on the west shore."
18d40: S689 "You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of
the White Cliffs. There is a narrow path heading south along the Cliffs and a
tight passage leading west into the cliffs themselves."
18da0: S690 "You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the Cliffs. A
narrow path leads north along the shore."
18dd4: S691 "You are on the east shore of the river. The water here seems
somewhat treacherous. A path travels from north to south here, the south end
quickly turning around a sharp corner."
18e2c: S692 "You are on a large sandy beach on the east shore of the river,
which is flowing quickly by. A path runs beside the river to the south here,
and a passage is partially buried in sand to the northeast."
18e8c: S693 "You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would
walk on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the Falls. The rainbow travels
east-west here."
18ee8: S694 "You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid
River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White
Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A
rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the
southwest."

climbable here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below.

You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a
passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon
bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears climbable."
1905c: S697 "You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here
there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.
Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of
the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north,
Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows
out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense
forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to
climb down into the canyon from here."
191a0: S698 "You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
mine. The shaft enters the west wall, and there is another exit on the south
end of the room."
191f0: S699 "You are in a small room. Strange squeaky sounds may be heard
coming from the passage at the north end. You may also escape to the east."

1924c: S703 "You are lifted up by the rising river! You try to swim, but the
currents are too strong. You come closer, closer to the awesome structure of
Flood Control Dam #3. The dam beckons to you. The roar of the water nearly
deafens you, but you remain conscious as you tumble over the dam toward your
certain doom among the rocks at its base."

19328: S705 ", tastes it, and throws it to the ground in disgust."
19344: S706 "Trolls tend not to be conversational. They require a much more
direct approach."
19378: S707 "Now, the alternative solution:"
1938c: S708 "How silly!"
19394: S709 "Looking into it can be fun."
193a4: S710 "The Thief is a cunning and dangerous opponent, skilled in the
martial arts. Novice Zorkers would do well to avoid him."
193f0: S711 "The Thief, of course."
19400: S712 "The Thief is constantly moving about."

19458: S716 "Shifting in the midst of a thrust, the thief knocks you
temporarily unconscious with the haft of his stiletto."

death."

19584: S729 "You can't be afraid to try anything in ZORK I (but it may make
sense to SAVE your state first)."
195c0: S730 "No. You won't ever get up the ramp."
195d4: S731 "You can leave from the altar end by going down, but you ~haven't a
prayer~ of getting the coffin down that hole."
19614: S732 "You can turn the bolt."
19620: S733 "You can say BOARD (or GET IN), DISEMBARK (or GET OUT), LAUNCH, and
LAND (or a direction towards a landing area). You can also let the current
carry you."
1969c: S734 "You can cross it and get the pot of gold."
196b4: S735 "You can't."
196bc: S736 "You can make a diamond out of coal."
196d0: S737 "You can almost always avoid a confrontation by walking away.
Although you may be robbed, at least you won't be killed."
19714: S738 "You can get the contents of the bag by defeating him in a fight."
1973c: S739 "Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity."

19878: S751 "It appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid
you are dead."
198a0: S752 "Lying in one corner of the room is a beautifully carved crystal
skull. It appears to be grinning at you rather nastily."

apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold
inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs,
