10a90: S099 "This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings which were here have
been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through either
the north or west exits."
10b06: S100 "This is what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls
and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough,
nothing of value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an open door

enter."
10e98: S113 "You are on the gently flowing stream. The upstream route is too
narrow to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
walls. There is a narrow beach to land on."

the east, northwest and southwest. A stairway leads down. You can hear the
sound of flowing water below."
111ca: S124 "This is a cave. Passages exit to the west and to the east, but the
cave narrows to a crack to the south. The earth is particularly damp here."
1122e: S125 "It is too narrow for most insects."
11246: S126 "This is a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast."
11274: S127 "A chasm runs southwest to northeast and the path follows it. You
are on the south side of the chasm, where a crack opens into a passage."
112d2: S128 "Are you out of your mind?"
112e4: S129 "Some invisible force prevents you from passing through the gate."
11310: S130 "You have entered the Land of the Living Dead, a large desolate
room. Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the sounds of
thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning. In the east corner are stacked the
remains of dozens of previous adventurers who were less fortunate than
yourself. A passage exits to the north."
113f2: S131 "You have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and
east."
11422: S132 "This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an
ascending staircase to the west."
11464: S133 "You cannot go down without fracturing many bones."
11486: S134 "You cannot reach the rope."
1149a: S135 "This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an
ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the
prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to
the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars."
1155e: S136 "This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what
appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads
into darkness. You probably could not get back up it."
115e8: S137 "You haven't a prayer of getting the coffin down that hole."
11612: S138 "This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
the dam. There are exits here to the north and east marked 'Private', though
the doors are open, and an exit to the south."
11696: S139 "This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood
Control Dam #3. Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a group of
buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC. However, they are of different colors: 
Blue, Yellow, Brown, and Red. The doors to this room are in the west and south
ends."
117a6: S140 "You are at the base of Flood Control Dam #3, which looms above you
and to the north. The river Frigid is flowing by here. Along the river are the
White Cliffs which seem to form giant walls stretching from north to south
along the shores of the river as it winds its way downstream."
1186c: S141 "You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the Dam. The river
flows quietly here. There is a landing on the west shore."
118c4: S142 "You cannot go upstream due to strong currents."
118e4: S143 "The White Cliffs prevent your landing here."
11904: S144 "The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the Dam.
The White Cliffs loom on the east bank and large rocks prevent landing on the
west."
1196e: S145 "There is no safe landing spot here."
11988: S146 "Just in time you steer away from the rocks."
119a6: S147 "The river descends here into a valley. There is a narrow beach on
the west shore below the cliffs. In the distance a faint rumbling can be
heard."
11a0c: S148 "You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of
the White Cliffs. There is a narrow path heading south along the Cliffs and a
tight passage leading west into the cliffs themselves."
11a94: S149 "The path is too narrow."
11aa6: S150 "The path is too tight."
11ab6: S151 "You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the Cliffs. A
narrow path leads north along the shore."
11b00: S152 "The river is running faster here and the sound ahead appears to be
that of rushing water. On the east shore is a sandy beach. A small area of
beach can also be seen below the cliffs on the west shore."
11b8a: S153 "You can land either to the east or the west."
11baa: S154 "The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here. On the east
shore is a large landing area."
11bee: S155 "You are on the east shore of the river. The stream here seems
somewhat treacherous. A path travels from north to south here, the south end
quickly turning around a sharp corner."
11c6a: S156 "You are on a large sandy beach on the east shore of the river,
which is flowing quickly by. A path runs beside the river to the south here,
and a passage is partially buried in sand to the northeast."
11cf4: S157 "This is a sand-filled cave whose exit is to the southwest."
11d1e: S158 "It's a long way..."
11d2c: S159 "You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would
walk on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the Falls. The rainbow travels
east-west here."
11d9c: S160 "You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid
River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White
Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A
rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the
southwest."
11e70: S161 "You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be
climbable here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below.
To the north is a narrow path."
11ee6: S162 "You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a
passage which it is impossible to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above
you is more cliff, which appears climbable."
11f9e: S163 "You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here
there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.
Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of
the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north,
Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows
out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense
forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to
climb down into the canyon from here."
12134: S164 "You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
mine. The shaft enters the west wall, and there is another exit on the south
end of the room."
121a0: S165 "You are in a small room. Strange squeaky sounds may be heard
coming from the passage at the north end. You may also escape to the east."
121fe: S166 "This is a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
descending through the floor into darkness below. To the west and the north are
exits from this room. Constructed over the top of the shaft is a metal
framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached."
122b2: S167 "You wouldn't fit and would die if you could."
122d2: S168 "This is a small non-descript room. However, from the direction of
a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected. To the south is a
narrow tunnel."
12340: S169 "This is a small room which smells strongly of coal gas. There is a
short climb up some stairs and a narrow tunnel leading east."
12398: S170 "This is a very small room. In the corner is a rickety wooden
ladder, leading downward. It might be safe to descend. There is also a
staircase leading upward."
12408: S171 "This is a rather wide room. On one side is the bottom of a narrow
wooden ladder. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room."
12468: S172 "You have come to a dead end in the mine."
12484: S173 "This is a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
timbers. A wide passage comes from the east and turns at the  west end of the
room into a very narrow passageway. From the west comes a strong draft."
12518: S174 "You cannot fit through this passage with that load."
1253c: S175 "This is a small drafty room in which is the bottom of a long
shaft. To the south is a passageway and to the east a very narrow passage. In
the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain."
125b8: S176 "The chain is not climbable."
125cc: S177 "This is a non-descript part of a coal mine."
125ec: S178 "This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal
mine. On the south wall of the chamber the letters ~Granite Wall~ are etched in
the rock. To the east is a long passage, and there is a steep metal slide
twisting downward. To the north is a small opening."
126ac: S179 "Oh, no!  You have walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking
grue!"
126de: S180 " "
126e0: S181 "  "
126e2: S182 "   "
126e4: S183 "    "
126e8: S184 "Oh, no!  A lurking grue slithered into the room and devoured you!"
12718: S185 "Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
glue. As a result, your mouth gets glued together (with your nose) and you die
of respiratory failure."
1278e: S186 "Such language in a high-class establishment like this!"
127b4: S187 "You ought to be ashamed of yourself."
127ce: S188 "Oh, dear. Such language from a supposed winning adventurer!"
127fa: S189 "Hello."
12800: S190 "Good day."
12808: S191 "Nice weather we've been having lately."
12824: S192 "Goodbye."
1282c: S193 "Are you enjoying yourself?"
12840: S194 "Wheeeeeeeeee!!!!!"
1284e: S195 "Do you expect me to applaud?"
12862: S196 "You should have looked before you leaped."
12880: S197 "I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame."
128a8: S198 "Geronimo....."
128b2: S199 "Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time."
128d4: S200 "kill"
128d8: S201 "attack"
128dc: S202 "Kicking the "
128e6: S203 "Waving the "

1292a: S208 " doesn't seem to work."
1293a: S209 " isn't notably helpful."
1294c: S210 " doesn't work."
12958: S211 " has no effect."
12964: S212 "I don't really see how."
12976: S213 "I think that swimming is best performed in water."
12998: S214 "Perhaps it is your head that is swimming."
129b6: S215 "With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry."
129e4: S216 "The window closes (more easily than it opened)."
12a06: S217 "The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase
descending into darkness."
12a3e: S218 "The door swings shut and closes."
12a56: S219 "A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all
passages out of the room."
12a92: S220 "A troll is here."
12a9e: S221 "An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor. All passages out of
the room are open."
12ada: S222 "The leaves burn, and so do you."
12af2: S223 "The grating opens."
12b00: S224 "The grating opens to reveal trees above you."
12b20: S225 "As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
overmastering will. Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade is an inch
from your neck. The knife seems to sing as it savagely slits your throat."
12bb6: S226 "I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in."
12bde: S227 "up to your ankles."
12bec: S228 "up to your shin."
12bf8: S229 "up to your knees."
12c04: S230 "up to your hips."
12c10: S231 "up to your waist."
12c1c: S232 "up to your chest."
12c28: S233 "up to your neck."
12c34: S234 "over your head."
12c40: S235 "high in your lungs."
12c4e: S236 "The room is full of water and cannot be entered."
12c70: S237 "I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself."
12c8e: S238 "The cyclops, tired of all of your games and trickery, eats you.
The cyclops says 'Mmm. Just like Mom used to make 'em.'"
12ce6: S239 "The cyclops seems somewhat agitated."
12d00: S240 "The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated."
12d22: S241 "The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something."
12d4c: S242 "The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper. I think he is
gathering condiments for his upcoming snack."
12d94: S243 "The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner."
12dbc: S244 "You have two choices: 1. Leave  2. Become dinner."
12de4: S245 "There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
ground. His bag and stiletto seem to have vanished."
12e36: S246 "Look around."
12e40: S247 "You think it isn't?"
12e50: S248 "I think you've already done that."
12e68: S249 "You cannot damage this door."
12e7c: S250 "The door is still under warranty."
12e94: S251 "The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the
darkness,  'Your disrespect costs you your life!' and places your head on a
sharp pole."
12efc: S252 "A booming voice says 'Wrong, cretin!' and you notice that you have
turned into a pile of dust."
12f40: S253 "There is a worthless piece of canvas here."
12f5e: S254 "The lamp appears a bit dimmer."
12f74: S255 "The lamp is definitely dimmer now."
12f8c: S256 "The lamp is nearly out."
12f9e: S257 "The candles grow shorter."
12fb0: S258 "The candles are becoming quite short."
12fca: S259 "The candles won't last long now."
12fe2: S260 "              ** BOOOOOOOOOOOM **"
13000: S261 "The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have left it,
leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported by water vapor."
1305a: S262 "A valiant attempt."
13068: S263 "You can't be serious."
13078: S264 "Not bloody likely."
13086: S265 "An interesting idea..."
13096: S266 "What a concept!"
130a2: S267 "You splash around for a while, fighting the current, then you
drown."
130d2: S268 "Unfortunately, a rubber raft doesn't provide much protection from
the unfriendly sorts of rocks and boulders one meets at the bottom of many
waterfalls. Including this one."
1314a: S269 "The hole collapses, smothering you."
13164: S270 "You seem to be digging a hole here."
1317e: S271 "The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it."
131a2: S272 "You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides."
131c6: S273 "If you insist.... Poof, you're dead!"
131e4: S274 "That was just a bit too far down."
131fc: S275 "Your "
13200: S276 " misses the "
13208: S277 " by an inch."
13212: S278 "A good slash, but it misses the "
1322a: S279 " by a mile."
13232: S280 "You charge, but the "
13242: S281 " jumps nimbly aside."
13250: S282 "Clang! Crash! The "
13260: S283 " parries."
13268: S284 "A quick stroke, but the "
1327a: S285 " is on guard."
13284: S286 "A good stroke, but it's too slow, the "
132a0: S287 " dodges."
132a6: S288 " crashes down, knocking the "
132ba: S289 " into dreamland."
132c6: S290 "The "
132ca: S291 " is battered into unconsciousness."
132e2: S292 "A furious exchange, and the "
132f6: S293 " is knocked out!"
13302: S294 "The haft of your "
1330e: S295 " knocks out the "
1331a: S296 "."
1331c: S297 "It's curtains for the "
1332c: S298 " as your "

1338e: S303 " is struck on the arm, blood begins to trickle down."
133b2: S304 " pinks the "
133ba: S305 " on the wrist, but it's not serious."
133d4: S306 "Your stroke lands, but it was only the flat of the blade."
133fc: S307 "The blow lands, making a shallow gash in the "
1341c: S308 "'s arm!"
13422: S309 " receives a deep gash in his side."
1343a: S310 "A savage blow on the thigh!  The "
13452: S311 " is stunned but can still fight!"
13468: S312 "Slash!  Your blow lands!  That one hit an artery, it could be
serious!"
1349c: S313 "Slash!  Your stroke connects!  This could be serious!"
134c4: S314 " is staggered, and drops to his knees."
134e0: S315 " is momentarily disoriented and can't fight back."
13502: S316 "The force of your blow knocks the "
1351a: S317 " back, stunned."
13526: S318 " is confused and can't fight back."
1353e: S319 "The quickness of your thrust knocks the "
1355a: S320 "'s weapon is knocked to the floor, leaving him unarmed."

135f0: S324 "The Cyclops trips over his feet trying to get at you."
13616: S325 "The Cyclops knocks you unconscious."

1365a: S327 "The Cyclops raises his arms and crushes your skull."
1367e: S328 "The Cyclops has just essentially ripped you to shreds."
136a4: S329 "The Cyclops breaks your neck with a massive smash."
136c8: S330 "A quick punch, but it was only a glancing blow."
136ea: S331 "The Cyclops grabs but you twist free, leaving part of your cloak."
13718: S332 "A glancing blow from the Cyclops' fist."
13736: S333 "The Cyclops gets a good grip and breaks your arm."
1375a: S334 "The monster smashes his huge fist into your chest, breaking
several ribs."

wall of the room."

free, breathless."

13958: S347 "The Cyclops seems unable to decide whether to broil or stew his
dinner."

knocking you out."

time."

stunned."

broadside into your head."

you."

protected, he wonders?"

grim nod."

into your ribs."

ends the battle and your life."

down."
13f4e: S387 "The thief draws blood, raking his stiletto across your arm."

from your leg."

wounded."

vision."

slippery with blood."

back."

you out of breath."
14108: S396 "The thief attacks, and you fall back desperately."

141c2: S403 " slips out of your hand."
141d4: S404 "The thief, a man of good breeding, refrains from attacking a
helpless opponent."
1420c: S405 "The thief amuses himself by searching your pockets."
