12538: S001 "You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest.
The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint
glow at the far end."
12598: S002 "You may not recall, but when you entered, the door of the barrow
shut behind you. There is no way out."
125d0: S003 "You are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it
opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent
mosses clinging to its high ceiling. A deep ravine winds through the cavern,
with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the ravine are steep and
crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south."
12690: S004 "As you start down, you slip on the crumbling rocks and pull back,
narrowly averting a fatal fall."
126cc: S005 "You are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing
a deep ravine. The path runs north and south from here."
1270c: S006 "The drop would be fatal."
12718: S007 "You'll have to specify a direction."
12730: S008 "This is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the
limestone. Stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. The room
glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move
all around you. A narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and
another leads northeast."
127da: S009 "You are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south
across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged
and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. Dim light
illuminates the cavern."
1285c: S010 "This is a dark tunnel with dim light to the northeast. The tunnel
is smooth but dusty and filled with twigs and leaves, debris which becomes
deeper as the tunnel branches into a wide corridor leading southwest and a
narrower one leading southeast."
128e8: S011 "There is a beautiful unicorn here cropping grass."
128fc: S012 "This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the
cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day
outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of
the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully
manicured path leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open
structure, painted white. It appears to be a gazebo."
129da: S013 "This is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. It is cool and
restful here. A tea table adorns the center of the gazebo."
12a1e: S014 "This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern
walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is of small
crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds from south to
north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To the south are peculiarly
shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the hedges to the west."
12ae0: S015 "This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the
cavern walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges
and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not recently been
clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of the bushes: There is a
dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge misshapen dog, and several human
figures. On the west side of the garden the path leads through a rose arbor
into a tunnel."
12be8: S016 "The path follows the south edge of a deep ravine and heads
northeast. A tunnel heads southwest, narrowing to a rather tight crawl. A faint
whirring sound can be heard in that direction. On the east is a ruined archway
choked with vegetation."
12c7a: S017 "The ravine is extremely deep. You would never make it."
12c9a: S018 "This is an arched hall of fine marble. The hall stops abruptly to
the north at a ford across a stream, where the marble is cracked and broken.
Perhaps a flood or collapse of the cave was responsible. To the south the hall
opens into a large room. There is rather annoying whirring sound coming from
that room."
12d46: S019 "That's a wall there."
12d52: S020 "You are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The
water is very cold. The walls of the ravine rise to east and west. There is a
small ledge along the north wall of the ravine. To the south is the entrance to
a well-constructed but somewhat ruined hall."
12dda: S021 "The stream deepens rapidly, and you wisely return before
drowning."
12e04: S022 "You notice that the ledge above would be a drier route west."
12e20: S023 "You are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep ravine. The
ledge continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is
possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream."
12e90: S024 "A ledge from the east ends here, and a tunnel leads north into the
wall. There is a rather odd smokey odor in the warm air of the tunnel."
12ed4: S025 "There are a lot of sharp rocks down there."
12eec: S026 "The room is a large cavern full of broken stone. The walls are
scorched and there are deep scratches on the floor. A sooty dry smell is very
strong here. A paved path winds from a large passage to the west, through the
room, and across a huge stone bridge to the south. To the east a small crack is
visible. A dark and smokey tunnel leads north."
12fa0: S027 "The dragon hisses at you and blocks your way."
12fb6: S028 "You are in the dragon's lair, where the rock walls are scarred by
flame. A blackened doorway leads to the south."
12ff2: S029 "A rotten old wooden chest is in one corner among the debris."
13016: S030 "Nestled in the chest is a wrought gold statuette of a dragon."
1303e: S031 "A huge red dragon is lying on the rocks here, watching."
1305a: S032 "A huge red dragon is lying here, blocking the entrance to a tunnel
leading north. Smoke curls from his nostrils and out between his teeth."
130a8: S033 "A huge dead dragon is lying half blocking the stream."
130c6: S034 "A beautiful young woman, wearing a dirty and bedraggled gown, sits
on a rock in the corner. Her hair is unkempt and she is oblivious to your
presence, almost in a trance."
13126: S035 "A path leads east-west through a room decorated with beautiful
frescoes of someone battling dragons and rescuing fair maidens. It is hard to
tell who is doing this as those parts of the frescoes have been blackened and
cracked by intense heat."
131ac: S036 "This is the middle of a ruined but still impressive stone bridge
spanning a deep chasm. Water flows far beneath. A paved path leads north into a
large open space. To the south, the path leads into a misty tunnel."
13224: S037 "It's a long way down."
13234: S038 "The room is cool and damp. The air is misty. A twisty path from
the southeast splits here toward a wide northerly stone bridge, and a narrow
westerly tunnel. It is from the latter that the mist and chill seem to
originate."
132ae: S039 " "
132b0: S040 "You don't even have an ice-pick."
132c2: S041 "You are in a tight chimney of solidified lava. It extends up at
least another hundred feet and down to a large room far below. A large crack
opens to the south, probably the result of a shift in the rock strata."
13336: S042 "A winding corridor is filled with cobwebs. Some are broken and the
dust on the floor is disturbed. The trend of the twists and turns is northeast
to southwest. On the north side of one twist, high up, is a narrow crack."
133b0: S043 "This is a small chamber carved out of the rock at the end of a
short crawl. On the wall is crudely chiseled the number ~8~."
133f6: S044 "You are trying to walk through an enormous rock."
1340c: S045 "This room looks like it was once a kennel for a very large dog
(some of the bones would fit a dinosaur). It apparently hasn't been used for a
long time, as the dust is fairly thick all over. The only exit is northeast."
13480: S046 "A gigantic dog collar, large enough for three rhinoceros-sized
dogs, is lying amidst the debris."
134bc: S047 "A long wooden club lies on the ground near the diamond-shaped
window. The club is curiously burned at the thick end."
13500: S048 "The words ~Babe Flathead~ are burned into the wood."
13520: S049 "A marble stairway leads down into the gloom and a passage leads
north."
13546: S050 "A small room with oddly angled walls and passages in all
directions."
1356a: S051 "This is the entrance to a huge crypt or tomb. A marble stairway
leads up from a gateway arch."
1359e: S052 "The huge dog snaps nastily at you."
135b2: S053 "There is a vicious-looking dog guarding the entrance. It is more
or less your usual dog, except that it has three heads and is the size of an
elephant."
13608: S054 "~Here lie the Flatheads, whose heads were placed on poles by the
Keeper of the Dungeon for amazing untastefulness.~"
13652: S055 "This is the workshop of the Wizard of Frobozz."
13668: S056 "This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and
west, and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks on
the walls, but the Wizard's workbench dominates the room. It is made of dark,
heavy wood bound with iron. The workbench is stained from many years of use,
and is deeply gouged as though some huge clawed animal was imprisoned on it.
There are burn marks and even notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane
items are scattered about the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives
of various sizes, odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the
center of a relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands - ruby,
sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle."
13800: S057 "There is a strange black sphere here."
13812: S058 "This is the Wizard's trophy room, filled with memorabilia of
various sorts. On one wall is the Wizard's D. T. (Doctor of Thaumaturgy) degree
from GUE Tech. Several old magic wands are mounted on a wand rack. A collection
of dull and nicked swords testify to the fate of many foolhardy adventurers.
Small bottles contain discarded homunculi (a few preserved in alcohol). There
is a stuffed owl on a perch."
13904: S059 "The text is in some obscure tongue. All that can be made out is a
reference to ~sending in a matchbook cover.~"
13944: S060 "A hand-lettered label is affixed to the wall."
13962: S061 "Warning!^^The exhibits in this room are the property of the mighty
Wizard of Frobozz (me), and are the fruits of diligent labor and study over
many years. He who touches anything will regret it.^^(signed)^Frobozz^"
139e0: S062 "Imbedded in the wall is an ornate trophy cabinet."
139fe: S063 "Shards of a smashed trophy case litter the room."
13a1c: S064 "In this room, inscribed on the floor, is a great pentagram drawn
with black chalk. In its center is a black circle."
13a5e: S065 "Here a dark hallway turns a corner. To the south is a dark room,
to the east is fitful light."
13a96: S066 "Filling the northern half of the room is a huge aquarium."
13ab6: S067 "There is a clear crystal sphere lying in the sand."
13acc: S068 "There is a baby sea serpent swimming in the aquarium."
13aec: S069 "There is a dead sea serpent in a heap here."
13b04: S070 "The floor here seems to be made of sand, but it is hard to see
anything else."
13b2c: S071 "This is a former broom closet. The exits are to the east and
west."
13b4e: S072 "You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano. High above you
light enters from the cone of the volcano. The only exit is to the north."
13b8c: S073 "You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.
The top of the volcano is clearly visible here."
13bc0: S074 "You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor. Looming
above is the rim of the volcano. There is a small ledge on the west side."
13bfc: S075 "You are high above the floor of the volcano. The rim of the
volcano looks very narrow and you are very near it. To the east is what appears
to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on."
13c4a: S076 "You are near the rim of the volcano. Above you it is open to the
sky. To the west, there is a place to land on a wide ledge."
13c8a: S077 "You are on a narrow ledge within an old dormant volcano. This
ledge is about halfway between the floor below and the rim above. There is an
exit to the south."
13cd2: S078 "I wouldn't jump from here."
13ce2: S079 "This must have been a large library, probably for the royal
family. All of the shelves have been gnawed to pieces by unfriendly gnomes. To
the north is an exit."
13d34: S080 "You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano. Below you the
volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano. A couple of
ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano; it appears that this ledge
is intermediate in elevation between those on the other side. The exit from
this room is to the east."
13dca: S081 "I wouldn't try that."
13dd8: S082 "It is impossible to cross this distance."
13df0: S083 "This is a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
There are exits here to the east and the south."
13e28: S084 "This is a large room full of assorted heavy machinery, whirring
noisily. The room smells of burned resistors. Along one wall are three buttons
which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square. Naturally, above these
buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC. A large sign in English above all
the buttons says^       ~DANGER -- HIGH VOLTAGE~^There are exits to the west
and the south."
13f1c: S085 "This is a dingy closet adjacent to a larger room to the north.
Chiselled into a wall are these words:^^     Protected by^       FROBOZZ^ Magic
Alarm Company^  (Hello, footpad!)^^There doesn't seem to be any footpad here,
however."
13fb0: S086 "You are trapped inside a solid steel cage."
13fca: S087 "You are at the top of the well. Well done. There are etchings on
the side of the well. There is a small crack across the floor at the entrance
to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily."
1402a: S088 "It's a long way down!"
1403a: S089 "This is a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
mortar. The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be some
etchings on the walls. There is a passageway to the west."
1409c: S090 "The walls cannot be climbed."
140a8: S091 "This is a small room containing a large oblong table, no doubt set
for afternoon tea. It is clear from the objects on the table that the users
were indeed mad. In the eastern corner of the room is a small hole (no more
than four inches high). There are passageways leading away to the west and the
northwest."
14152: S092 "Only a mouse could get in there."
14168: S093 "This is an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to be a
wooden roof. In fact, all objects in this room appear to be abnormally large.
To the east is a passageway. There are large gaping chasms to the west and
northwest."
141fc: S094 "A great chasm blocks your way."
1420e: S095 "This is a large room, one half of which is depressed. Salty water
flows from a large leak in the ceiling. The only exit is to the west."
14254: S096 "This is the entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest banking
institution of the Great Underground Empire. A partial account of its history
is in ~The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads,~ in the chapter on J. Pierpont
Flathead. A more detailed history (albeit less objective) may be found in
Flathead's outrageous autobiography ~I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!~. Most
of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers. All that remains are
two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of the room, which say:^^   
<--  VIEWING ROOMS  -->^^The way out (ornate but tasteful) is to the east. "
143dc: S097 "This room was used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
their contents. On the north side of the room is a sign which says:^^~Remain
here while the teller retrieves your safety deposit box. When you are finished,
leave the box, and exit to the south. Safety deposit boxes cannot be removed
from this room!^^Thank You for Banking at the Zork!~ "
144a2: S098 "This room was used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view

leave the box, and exit to the south. Safety deposit boxes cannot be removed
from this room!^^Thank You for Banking at the Zork!~ "
14566: S099 "This is a small, bare room with no distinguishing features. There
are no exits from this room."
14594: S100 "This is the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no
doors."
145b6: S101 "This is a large rectangular room. The east and west walls were
used for storing safety deposit boxes, but all have been carefully removed by
evil persons. To the east, west, and south of the room are large doorways. The
northern ~wall~ of the room is a shimmering curtain of light. In the center of
the room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side. Engraved on the side
of the cube is some lettering."
1468c: S102 "There is a curtain of light there."
1469c: S103 "This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork. Like
the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized. The lone exit is to
the north."
146f0: S104 "There is a matchbook saying ~Visit ZORK I~ here."
14712: S105 "~>> Visit Exotic ZORK I <<^^Consult the Frobozz Magic Travel
Agency, or visit your local computer store for more details.~"
1476c: S106 "There is a nervous Volcano Gnome here."

seem ready to collapse."

14cd6: S138 "It is written in an unfamiliar tongue and details the use of
various magical objects, chiefly the so-called ~magic wand~. Apparently these
devices work by pointing them at the object to be ensorcelled, and then
chanting the appropriate magic words. (It's truly amazing how credulous these
ancients were, isn't it?)"

purple prose, the like of which is rarely seen outside the Great Underground

into a pancake."

something. One by one your possessions glow bright green. Finally, you are
attacked by these magical wardens, and destroyed!"

dehydrated and thirsty."

not as compressible as your body, which is demolished."

drown. Sad, but true."

contents are fatal."

careless adventurer was playing with blasting cakes."

fields in the room are intense enough to electrocute you. I really don't know,
but in any event, something just killed you."

room are intense enough to fry the delicate innards of the robot. I really
don't know, but in any event, smoke pours from its ears and it has stopped
moving."

the ceiling, trapping him. You can faintly hear his last words: ~Whirr, buzz,
click!~ A cloud of smoke rising from beneath the cage confirms your fears about
the fate of your brave mechanical friend."

over the side. Oops, that was clumsy of you! You tripped on something and fell
in. Too bad."

seems, is only a small mouthful for the poor animal, who is just as hungry
afterward."

It is wearing a huge dog collar."
15ecc: S265 "Cerberus tears you limb from limb! What ferocity!"
15eec: S266 "That wasn't such a good idea. The creature was enjoying being your
pet. As you unfasten the collar, the disappointed monster hound begins to
growl, and then its three fang-crammed mouths rend you into little doggy
biscuits."

him a bit. He looks at you as if deciding whether or not to eat you."

direction and sighs."
1605e: S272 "incinerates you in a blast of white-hot dragon fire."
1607c: S273 "A huge ball of flame envelops you, but you don't even feel the
heat. The dragon is puzzled, but not too puzzled to crush you in his jaws."
160c4: S274 "Worse for you, his mouth opens and a great gout of flame puffs out
and consumes you on the spot."
160fa: S275 "The topiary animals attack! You are crushed by their branches and
clawed by their thorns."

16178: S278 "A unicorn is cropping grass on the other side of the room. A gold
key hangs from a ribbon around its neck."
161b0: S279 "There is a beautiful unicorn eating roses here. Around his neck is
a red satin ribbon on which is strung a tiny key."

16226: S288 "The door reluctantly closes."
16236: S289 "You drop into the aquarium with a splash (which attracts the
serpent). He greedily eats you. He's just a baby, after all, and needs all the
food he can get."
16292: S290 "Oh dear, you have cut yourself severely on the broken glass. I'm
afraid you've bled to death."
162ce: S291 "The flask shatters, and poison gas fills the room!"
162ea: S292 "A shattered aquarium fills the northern half of the room."
1630c: S293 "I guess you were too careless."

blow of his enormous hand."

and are not great services bought at great price?"

163e2: S299 "Ah, truly magnificent! Keep them coming."
16400: S300 "Almost halfway there, oh worthy one!"
16418: S301 "Oh, such beauty! Your generosity almost overwhelms me!"
1643a: S302 "Truly I shall do thee a wonderful service when thou hast
finished!"
16468: S303 "Truly you are most generous! But still, this is yet not enough."
1648e: S304 "A fine gift, mighty one, you have almost reached my fee."
164ae: S305 "Wondrous fine, master! But one treasure is yet to be given!"

towards the bottom of the volcano."

as far as possible from him."

move a muscle."
16620: S325 "You begin to feel lightheaded."
16632: S326 "You rush at the Wizard, intending to tear him limb from limb."
16656: S327 "You feel more energetic now."
16668: S328 "You suddenly decide that the Wizard isn't that terrifying..."
1668a: S329 "Your little finger begins to twitch, and then your whole body is
free again."

166c8: S331 "You feel cooler and less angry now."
166de: S332 "You sink quietly down again."
166f0: S333 "The Wizard snatches the wand away, muttering the word ~Float~ at
the robot. Unfortunately he has no floating-point processor and dies in a vain
attempt to divide 4.85 by 3.62."
16760: S334 "The wand was still recharging from its last use. It discharges
magic all over everything. You turn into a toad, the room fills with a fetid
smell, and all sorts of other grubby things happen. Then the wand explodes!"
