structure is rather complicated. Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the
floor is open.^^As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right. The left panel is
mahogany, the right pine. The wall you face is red on its left half and black
on its right. On the entrance side, the wall is white opposite the red part of
the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the black section. The painted walls are
at least twice the length of the unpainted ones. The ceiling is painted
blue.^^In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot deep.
The channel is oriented in a north-south direction. In the exact center of the
room the channel widens into a circular depression perhaps two feet wide.
Incised in the stone around this area is a compass rose.^^Running from one
short wall to the other at about waist height is a wooden bar, carefully carved
and drilled. This bar is pierced in two places. The first hole is in the center
of the bar (and thus the center of the room). The second is at the left end of
the room (as you face opposite the entrance). Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.^^The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a foot
above the bar, and ends in a hand grip. The pole "

13c3c: S125 "Through the door you can hear voices which, from their sound,
belong to military or police personnel."
13c78: S126 "A particularly vicious-looking guard enters the room and sees you.
He grinds his teeth unpleasantly, pulls a waffle out of his garment, and
vaporizes you with a flick of his finger."
13ce2: S127 "This is an exhibit of Empire technology. A wooden door to the
south is "
13d00: S128 "."
13d02: S129 "This is a large hall which hosted the technological exhibits of
the Great Underground Empire. A door to the south is "
13d34: S130 "wage scales for guards"
13d42: S131 "the excessive nature of the Royal Government"
13d5a: S132 "the soon to be constructed Royal Puzzle"
13d70: S133 "the proper way to execute trespassers"
13d88: S134 "torturing thieves"
13d94: S135 "the banishment of the Wizard of Frobozz"
13dac: S136 "You are in a dark and quite creepy crawlway with passages leaving
to the north, east, south, and southwest."
13de4: S137 "You are at the eastern end of a dark, featureless landscape of
shallow hills. Paths to the east and southeast reenter the rock."
13e2a: S138 "Towering walls of rock bar your way."
13e42: S139 "You are in a shadowy land of low, rolling hills stretching out to
the west and south. The land is bordered to the north by a massive stone wall.
Ancient and weathered, the wall has crumbled enough at one point to permit
passage."
13eba: S140 "A stone wall blocks the way."
13ec8: S141 "You are in a dark and shadowy land. All around you are gentle
hills and eerie shadows. Far above, shrouded in mist, you can barely make out
the ceiling of the enormous cavern that spans this entire land."
13f3a: S142 "You are in an ominously dark land of rolling hills. The ground
becomes softer to the south."
13f6a: S143 "The ground becomes too soft to walk on in that direction."
13f88: S144 "You are at the southern end of a shadowy land. The ground here is
quite soft, and the area is surrounded by quicksand on most sides. North of
here is a terrain of shallow hills."
13fe4: S145 "The quicksand prevents movement in that direction."
14002: S146 "You are near the southern end of the land of shadow. The ground
here is soft and spongy, and it becomes quicksand to the south. North and east
of here are gentle, rolling hills. A gentle sea breeze wafts over a steeply
sloping path to the west."
14080: S147 "You are in a land of dark shadows and shallow hills, which stretch
out in all directions. To the west, the land dips sharply."
140c4: S148 "You are standing atop a steep cliff, looking west over a vast
ocean. Far below, the surf pounds at a sandy beach. To the south and east are
rolling hills filled with eerie shadows. A path cut into the face of the cliff
descends toward the beach. To the north is a tall stone wall, which ends at the
cliff edge. It was obviously built long ago, and directly north is a spot where
you could climb over the rubble of the decaying wall."
141b0: S149 "Between the rocks, wind, and waves, you wouldn't last a minute."
141d8: S150 "The quicksand prevents movement here."
141ee: S151 "stairs"
141f2: S152 "?"
141f4: S153 " appears to be badly hurt and defenseless."
1420a: S154 " is hurt, and its strength appears to be fading."
14224: S155 " has some wounds and is probably not capable of hindering your
movement."
1424c: S156 " has a light wound which hasn't affected its seemingly great
strength."
14276: S157 " has a great deal of strength, perhaps matching your own."
14296: S158 "A good parry! Your sword wounds the hooded figure!"
142b2: S159 "A quick stroke catches the hooded figure off guard! Blood trickles
down the figure's arm!"
142e8: S160 "The hooded figure is hit with a quick slash!"
142fc: S161 "Your move was not quick enough and misses the mark."
1431a: S162 "A quick stroke, but the hooded figure is on guard."
14332: S163 "A good stroke, but it's too slow."
14348: S164 "A good slash, but it misses by a mile."
14360: S165 "You charge, but the hooded figure jumps nimbly aside."
1437a: S166 "The hooded figure catches you off guard and wounds you!"
14394: S167 "You are wounded by a lightning thrust!"
143ac: S168 "Your quick reflexes cannot stop the hooded figure's stroke! You
are hit!"
143d2: S169 "In your wounded state, you cannot defend yourself against your
still-quick opponent. Slowly and carefully, the figure starts to remove its
hood as you fall to the ground, dead."
14434: S170 "The hooded figure stabs nonchalantly with its sword and misses."
14454: S171 "You dodge as the hooded figure comes in low."
14468: S172 "The hooded figure tries to sneak past your guard, but you twist
away."
1448a: S173 "The hooded figure thrusts, but you fight back and send it flying
to the ground!"
144b0: S174 "You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its
way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you,
casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail."
14528: S175 "The stairs are endless."
14536: S176 "You are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west
passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to
the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the
west."
145a4: S177 "You are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens
out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see
vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and
crumbling. To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening,
through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the
northwest."
14668: S178 "A stone wall blocks your way."
14676: S179 "You are at a sharp turn on a narrow and steeply sloping path,
strewn with boulders of various sizes. The path climbs sharply toward a
desolate plain to the southeast. Southwest of here the path winds down to the
base of a cliff."
146f6: S180 "You are at the base of a steep cliff. Directly above you is a wide
ledge and far above that some natural sunlight can be seen. To the northeast is
a steeply climbing path and the ground becomes sandy toward the south."
14764: S181 "You can't get up the rock face."
14774: S182 "The drop would kill you."
14780: S183 "There's no tree here suitable for climbing."
1479a: S184 "You attempt the climb but slide back down."
147b2: S185 "You are in a dank passage filled with a wispy fog. A spooky
passageway leads north and a wider path heads off to the south. To the west,
the path leaves the rock and enters an eerie, shadowy land."
1481e: S186 "You are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some
polished stone steps lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any
movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above."
14892: S187 "If you really want to enter the lake, you should say so."
148b4: S188 "The sheer rock face prevents movement along the lake shore."
148da: S189 "This is a small balcony carved into a near-vertical cliff. To the
east, stretching from north to south, stands a monumental aqueduct supported by
mighty stone pillars, some of which are starting to crumble from age. You feel
a sense of loss and sadness as you ponder this once-proud structure and the
failure of the Empire which created this and other engineering marvels. Some
stone steps lead up to the northwest."
149b6: S190 "The drop would be fatal."
149c2: S191 "You are floating on the surface of the lake. The water is ice cold
and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north
puts you at your starting point. Conditions to the east are poor where the lake
turns into swamp. The west and south shores are suitable for walking, however."
14a60: S192 "The swamp is impassable."
14a70: S193 "You are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake
is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering the
frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an extended stay.
The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there."
14b1a: S194 "You are already at the bottom of the lake."
14b2c: S195 "You are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite
hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's edge. The only
path leads into the rock to the south."
14b8c: S196 "If you want to enter the lake, you should say so."
14baa: S197 "Mounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room with
a flickering light."
14bda: S198 "A piece of bread is on the ground here."
14bee: S199 "It seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some
fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees."
14c2c: S200 "The staff is instantly consumed in a ball of flame. You along with
it."
14c56: S201 "A large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders."
14c7a: S202 "The man appears to be getting somewhat impatient."
14c94: S203 "Your friend at the cliff top has started pacing nervously around."
14cbc: S204 "~Yoo hoo!~ calls the man at the brink of the cliff. ~Remember
me?~"
14ce8: S205 "The man on the cliff waves at you. ~It would just take a moment to
tie that rope to the chest. I'd be much obliged, and there might even be
something in it for you!~"
14d40: S206 "A few small stones fall near your feet. You look up and see your
friend waving. ~I haven't got all day, fella. Be a pal and pass up the chest!~"
14d96: S207 "The man on the cliff clears his throat loudly. ~I don't mean to be
rushing you, but I do have some pressing engagements....~"
14dde: S208 "Oh, no! A tremendous fish just swallowed you whole!"
14e02: S209 "Your strength gives out, and you drown in the frigid waters."
14e24: S210 "The roc snatches you in its jaws and has you for lunch."
14e42: S211 "I"
14e44: S212 "II"
14e48: S213 "III"
14e4c: S214 "IV"
14e50: S215 "You see a passage cluttered with broken timbers. An extremely
narrow opening can be seen at the end of the room."
14e8a: S216 "You see a tiny room with rough walls. Chiseled crudely on one wall
is the number ~8~. The only apparent exit seems to be a blur."
14ed2: S217 "You see a wide room with two nearly identical passages leading
east and northeast. A wide channel descends steeply into the room and seems to
be blocked by rubble."
14f26: S218 "You see the interior of a huge temple rudely constructed of basalt
blocks. Flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over an altar still wet
with the blood of human sacrifice, its velvet covers stained and encrusted with
gore."
14fb4: S219 "Smokey the Bear puts out both the fire and you."
14fd0: S220 "This is a very small room. In the corner is a rickety wooden
ladder, leading downward. It might be safe to descend. There is also a
staircase leading upward."
15028: S221 "This is a rather wide room. On one side is the bottom of a narrow
wooden ladder. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room."
1506e: S222 "You have come to a dead end in the mine.^There is a small pile of
coal here."
15096: S223 "This is a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
timbers. A wide passage comes from the east and turns at the west end of the
room into a very narrow passageway. From the west comes a strong draft."
150fc: S224 "You cannot fit through this passage with that load."
1510c: S225 "This is a small chamber carved out of the rock at the end of a
short crawl. On the wall is crudely chiseled the number ~8~. The only apparent
exit, to the east, seems to be a blur and a loud, whirring sound resounds
through the rock."
1518c: S226 "You are repelled from the exit by a fierce wind."
151a6: S227 "A spray can is in the corner. In large type is the legend ~Frobozz
Magic Grue Repellent.~"
151de: S228 "!!! FROBOZZ MAGIC GRUE REPELLENT !!!^^Instructions for use: Apply
liberally to creature to be protected. Duration of effect is unpredictable. Use
only in place of death!^^(No warranty expressed or implied)"
1527e: S229 "The can explodes and you die a horribly smelly death."
1529e: S230 "Sacrificial Altar^This is the interior of a huge temple of
primitive construction. A few flickering torches cast a sallow illumination
over the altar, which is still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice.
Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards
you with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons. A low noise begins behind you,
and you turn to see hundreds of hunched and hairy shapes. A guttural chant
issues from their throats. Near you stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest
black, brandishing a huge sword. The chant grows louder as the robed figure
approaches the altar. The large figure spots you and approaches menacingly. It
reaches into its cloak and pulls out a great, glowing dagger. It pulls you onto
the altar and, with a murmur of approval from the throng, slices you neatly
across your abdomen."
1548c: S231 "You are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent
movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but
impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make
out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock."
1551e: S232 "The swamp is too thick."
1552c: S233 "If you want to go into the lake, you should say so."
1554a: S234 "You can't walk through a piece of metal."
1555e: S235 "The hole is too far above your head."
15570: S236 "You are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system
for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the
south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the
north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not
apparent."
1560e: S237 "You can't climb the dried-up waterfall."
15624: S238 "The arch before you is broken."
15632: S239 "It's a long way down...."
15646: S240 "The arch to the south is broken."
15656: S241 "You execute a perfect swan dive into the rocks below!"
15676: S242 "The light from above seems to be focused in the center of the
room, where a single key is lying in the dust."
156ac: S243 "The key is a long and heavy skeleton key."
156c4: S244 "The key is short and stubby, shaped like no lock you have ever
seen."
156ec: S245 "The key is round and thin, more like a pencil than a key."
15710: S246 "The key is shiny with many prongs."
15724: S247 "The key is sharp as an awl, and rusted badly."
15740: S248 "One of the stone figures (or maybe both, it's hard to tell)
suddenly springs to life and crushes you with his stone bludgeon."
15788: S249 "You enter the quicksand and slowly sink to a new low in
adventuring."
